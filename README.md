### Bollywood-Celebrity-Image-Predictor

### Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sushilyadav1998/bollywood-celeb-localized-face-dataset

### Project Description - 
This is a deep learning project to identify the face and predict resembles with the Bollywood Celebrity. When user gives the input image, deep learning model identifies the similarity and displays the output image. Web App is built using streamlit.

#### OpenCV
OpenCV is a real-time Computer Vision framework. It is used in many image processing and computer vision tasks

#### MTCNN
Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) is a framework developed as a solution for both face detection and face alignment. The process consists of three stages of convolutional networks that are able to recognize faces and facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth.

#### VGGFace
The VGGFace refers to a series of models developed for face recognition and demonstrated on benchmark computer vision datasets by members of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. There are two main VGG models for face recognition at the time of writing; they are VGGFace and VGGFace2

#### This app can be run as  - streamlit run app.py
